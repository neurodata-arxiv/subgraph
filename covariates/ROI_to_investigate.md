My DTI analysis indicates disruption on the connectivity in the 

septum 63
hippocampus 52
hypothalamus circuit  60 62 164 166

connected by the 

fimbria-fornix 121 123
possibly thalamic nuclei  74 158
cerebellum 92 93 94 95 96


A motor component - with connectivity through the internal capsule for example can also be expected. I am open to anything the data shows, and I think we have better data now.
