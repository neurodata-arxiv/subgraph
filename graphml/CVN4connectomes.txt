CVN for tractography/connectivityA DTI diffusion scheme was used, and a total of 12 diffusion sampling directions were acquired. The b-value was 1595 s/mm2. The in-plane resolution was 0.055 mm. The slice thickness was 0.055 mm. The diffusion tensor was calculated. A deterministic fiber tracking algorithm (Yeh et al., PLoS ONE 8(11): e80713) was used. A seeding region was placed at whole brain. The angular threshold was 60 degrees. The step size was 0.03 mm. The anisotropy threshold was 0.07. The fiber trajectories were smoothed by averaging the propagation direction with 1% of the previous direction. Tracks with length less than 1 mm were discarded. A total of 500000 seeds were placed. The analysis was conducted using DSI Studio (http://dsi-studio.labsolver.org).
